1. Stage all the changes and commit them with a meaningful commit message

git add .
git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message"


2. Move committed changes to the correct branch

# Assuming you're on the wrong branch
# Create a new branch from the current state
git branch temp-branch

# Switch back to the original branch where the commit should have gone
git checkout correct-branch

# Cherry-pick the commit(s) from the wrong branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Delete the temporary branch if no longer needed
git branch -D temp-branch


3. Create a new branch, make changes, and push the branch to the remote repository

# Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b new-branch

# Make your changes...

# Stage and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push the new branch to the remote repository
git push origin new-branch


4. Contribute to an open-source project hosted on GitHub

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-username/repository-name.git
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin your-feature-branch


5. Resolve merge conflicts

git checkout your-branch
git pull origin main
git add <file-with-conflict>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"


6. Create a feature branch based on the latest changes in the main branch

# Ensure you're on the main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to the new feature branch
git checkout -b new-feature-branch


7. Revert to a specific commit, discarding all changes made after that commit

# Use reset to go back to a specific commit and discard changes
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Force push to update the remote repository
git push --force


8. Restore a deleted file from the previous commit

# Checkout the file from the previous commit
git checkout HEAD^ -- path/to/deleted-file

# Stage and commit the restored file
git add path/to/deleted-file
git commit -m "Restore deleted file"
